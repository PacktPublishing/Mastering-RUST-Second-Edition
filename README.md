All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Rust!");
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
The book is aimed at beginner and intermediate programmers who already have familiarity with any imperative language and have only heard of Rust as a new language. If you are a developer who wants to write robust, efficient and maintainable software systems and want to become proficient with Rust, this book is for you. It starts by giving a whirlwind tour of the important concepts of Rust and covers advanced features of the language in subsequent chapters using code examples that readers will find useful to advance their knowledge.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-17).
